# Wordle React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It is a clone of the popular [Wordle Game](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/)

## How to Play

The game shows you a brief tutorial, that explains the rules of the game. You have to guess the correct word, before the amount of tries is over. Everytime you guess a word,
the game tells you which letters are in the correct place, are in the word in an incorrect place, or not in the word.

Try to guess the word, before your tries run out!
